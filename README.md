# Cleaning-Data-in-SQL-Queries

In this Nashville Housing Data project, the focus is on enhancing data quality and structure through SQL queries. 
Initially, the property address is refined by breaking it into individual columns: Address, City, and State, facilitating better analysis. 
The "Sold as Vacant" field is standardized, substituting 'Y' and 'N' with 'Yes' and 'No,' respectively, for clarity. 
Duplicates are eliminated, ensuring data integrity. Lastly, unnecessary columns are expunged, streamlining the dataset and optimizing storage. 
This systematic data cleaning process not only promotes accuracy but also enhances the dataset's usability, paving the way for more insightful analyses in the realm of Nashville housing trends.
